## qb-jumpscares just for fun
- just for fun to jumpscare your player on specified locations using polyzone and timer


## NOTE for hunted school ymap
- if you have the hunted school ymap, you realy have to use this, the secret is inside the school, as far as i tested this, every player has been there,
- and because they want to know what `The Secret` is and then they get a jumpscare, and you allready know what happens then lol :D
- when a player go inside the school for the first time, a timer is started, and on a random count the jumpscare will happen.
-
- And once you've been inside the school, you can't go back, well you can go outside but you get the jumpscare anyway.
-
- The timer is total random, so any player get a jumpscare on a different location in the school, but only 1 time. 
- The next time it will not work, it will only work again, when you reatart the server. or by `ensure qb-jumpscares`


## You can also jumpscare by command :D
- for 1 player only, use `/jumpscareplayer [id]`
- to jumpscare all the players on the server, use `/jumpscare`


## Enjoy using this mod ;)
