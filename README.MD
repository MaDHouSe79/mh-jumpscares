## qb-jumpscares just for fun
- just for fun to jumpscare your player on a specified location(s)


## NOTE for hunted school ymap
- if you have the hunted school ymap, you can use this, the secret is inside the school.
- when a player go inside the school for the first time, a timer is started, and on a random count the jumpscare will happen.
- This timer is total random, so any player get a jumpscare on a different location in the school, but only 1 time. 
- The next time it will not work, it will only work again, when you reatart the server.


## you can also jumpscare by command 
- for 1 player only, use `/jumpscareplayer [id]`
- to jumpscare all the players on the server, use `/jumpscare`


## Enjoy this mod ;)
